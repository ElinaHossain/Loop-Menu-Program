## What does it do?
This program functions as a menu-driven tool enabling users to choose from a range of options for generating and displaying shapes made of asterisks. The available shapes include rectangles, downward and upward-facing right triangles, as well as rectangles with random dimensions. Users can also opt to exit the program, and the system incorporates checks to handle and rectify any improper menu selections.

## What I learned:
- Menu-driven program
- Input validation
- Switch statement
- Random number generation
- Nested loops

## How could I improve the program:
- Use constants for menu options, instead of hardcoding the menu options as numbers in the switch statement, you can define constants (e.g., using final int OPTION_RECTANGLE = 1;) to make the code more readable and maintainable.
- I would also print out the exact reason why there is an error after the user inputs their answer. (e.g. user inputting "Name," and the output would be an error message saying "It is not an integer between 1-5, try again.")
